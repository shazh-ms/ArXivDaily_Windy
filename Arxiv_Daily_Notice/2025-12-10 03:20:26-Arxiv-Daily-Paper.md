 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes the BUT submission to the ESDD 2026 Challenge, specifically focusing on Track 1: Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection with Unseen Generators. To address the critical challenge of generalizing to audio generated by unseen synthesis algorithms, we propose a robust ensemble framework leveraging diverse Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of general audio SSL models (including BEATs, EAT, and Dasheng) and speech-specific SSLs. These front-ends are coupled with a lightweight Multi-Head Factorized Attention (MHFA) back-end to capture discriminative representations. Furthermore, we introduce a feature domain augmentation strategy based on distribution uncertainty modeling to enhance model robustness against unseen spectral distortions. All models are trained exclusively on the official EnvSDD data, without using any external resources. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: our best single system achieved Equal Error Rates (EER) of 0.00\%, 4.60\%, and 4.80\% on the Development, Progress (Track 1), and Final Evaluation sets, respectively. The fusion system further improved generalization, yielding EERs of 0.00\%, 3.52\%, and 4.38\% across the same partitions.

 - **Abstract**
 Lightweight, real-time text-to-speech systems are crucial for accessibility. However, the most efficient TTS models often rely on lightweight phonemizers that struggle with context-dependent challenges. In contrast, more advanced phonemizers with a deeper linguistic understanding typically incur high computational costs, which prevents real-time performance. This paper examines the trade-off between phonemization quality and inference speed in G2P-aided TTS systems, introducing a practical framework to bridge this gap. We propose lightweight strategies for context-aware phonemization and a service-oriented TTS architecture that executes these modules as independent services. This design decouples heavy context-aware components from the core TTS engine, effectively breaking the latency barrier and enabling real-time use of high-quality phonemization models. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system improves pronunciation soundness and linguistic accuracy while maintaining real-time responsiveness, making it well-suited for offline and end-device TTS applications.
