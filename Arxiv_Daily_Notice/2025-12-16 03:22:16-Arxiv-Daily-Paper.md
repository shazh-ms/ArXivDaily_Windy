#### All-in-One ASR: Unifying Encoder-Decoder Models of CTC, Attention, and Transducer in Dual-Mode ASR
 - **Authors:** Takafumi Moriya, Masato Mimura, Tomohiro Tanaka, Hiroshi Sato, Ryo Masumura, Atsunori Ogawa

 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes a unified framework, All-in-One ASR, that allows a single model to support multiple automatic speech recognition (ASR) paradigms, including connectionist temporal classification (CTC), attention-based encoder-decoder (AED), and Transducer, in both offline and streaming modes. While each ASR architecture offers distinct advantages and trade-offs depending on the application, maintaining separate models for each scenario incurs substantial development and deployment costs. To address this issue, we introduce a multi-mode joiner that enables seamless integration of various ASR modes within a single unified model. Experiments show that All-in-One ASR significantly reduces the total model footprint while matching or even surpassing the recognition performance of individually optimized ASR models. Furthermore, joint decoding leverages the complementary strengths of different ASR modes, yielding additional improvements in recognition accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly used to document clinical encounters, yet its reliability in multilingual and demographically diverse Indian healthcare contexts remains largely unknown. In this study, we conduct the first systematic audit of ASR performance on real world clinical interview data spanning Kannada, Hindi, and Indian English, comparing leading models including Indic Whisper, Whisper, Sarvam, Google speech to text, Gemma3n, Omnilingual, Vaani, and Gemini. We evaluate transcription accuracy across languages, speakers, and demographic subgroups, with a particular focus on error patterns affecting patients vs. clinicians and gender based or intersectional disparities. Our results reveal substantial variability across models and languages, with some systems performing competitively on Indian English but failing on code mixed or vernacular speech. We also uncover systematic performance gaps tied to speaker role and gender, raising concerns about equitable deployment in clinical settings. By providing a comprehensive multilingual benchmark and fairness analysis, our work highlights the need for culturally and demographically inclusive ASR development for healthcare ecosystem in India.

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for African languages remains constrained by limited labeled data and the lack of systematic guidance on model selection, data scaling, and decoding strategies. Large pre-trained systems such as Whisper, XLS-R, MMS, and W2v-BERT have expanded access to ASR technology, but their comparative behavior in African low-resource contexts has not been studied in a unified and systematic way. In this work, we benchmark four state-of-the-art ASR models across 13 African languages, fine-tuning them on progressively larger subsets of transcribed data ranging from 1 to 400 hours. Beyond reporting error rates, we provide new insights into why models behave differently under varying conditions. We show that MMS and W2v-BERT are more data efficient in very low-resource regimes, XLS-R scales more effectively as additional data becomes available, and Whisper demonstrates advantages in mid-resource conditions. We also analyze where external language model decoding yields improvements and identify cases where it plateaus or introduces additional errors, depending on the alignment between acoustic and text resources. By highlighting the interaction between pre-training coverage, model architecture, dataset domain, and resource availability, this study offers practical and insights into the design of ASR systems for underrepresented languages.
