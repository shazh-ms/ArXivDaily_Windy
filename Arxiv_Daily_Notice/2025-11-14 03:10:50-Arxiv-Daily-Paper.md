 - **Abstract**
 Flow-Matching (FM)-based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems exhibit high-quality speech synthesis and robust generalization capabilities. However, the speaker representation ability of such systems remains underexplored, primarily due to the lack of explicit speaker-specific supervision in the FM framework. To this end, we conduct an empirical analysis of speaker information distribution and reveal its non-uniform allocation across time steps and network layers, underscoring the need for adaptive speaker alignment. Accordingly, we propose Time-Layer Adaptive Speaker Alignment (TLA-SA), a loss that enhances speaker consistency by jointly leveraging temporal and hierarchical variations in speaker information. Experimental results show that TLA-SA significantly improves speaker similarity compared to baseline systems on both research- and industrial-scale datasets and generalizes effectively across diverse model architectures, including decoder-only language models (LM) and FM-based TTS systems free of LM.
#### A Study of Binaural Deep Beamforming With Interpretable Beampatterns Guided by Time-Varying RTF

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, a deep beamforming framework for speech enhancement in dynamic acoustic environments is studied. The time-varying beamformer weights are estimated from the noisy multichannel signals by minimizing an SI-SDR loss. The estimation is guided by the continuously tracked relative transfer functions (RTFs) of the moving target speaker. The spatial behavior of the network is evaluated through both narrowband and wideband beampatterns under three settings: (i) oracle guidance using true RTFs, (ii) estimated RTFs obtained by a subspace tracking method, and (iii) without the RTF guidance. Results show that RTF-guided models produce smoother, spatially consistent beampatterns that accurately track the target's direction of arrival. In contrast, the model fails to maintain a clear spatial focus when guidance is absent. Using the estimated RTFs as guidance closely matches the oracle RTF behavior, confirming the effectiveness of the tracking scheme. The model also outputs a binaural signal to preserve the speaker's spatial cues, which promotes hearing aid and hearables applications.
#### MTR-DuplexBench: Towards a Comprehensive Evaluation of Multi-Round Conversations for Full-Duplex Speech Language Models
 - **Authors:** He Zhang, Wenqian Cui, Haoning Xu, Xiaohui Li, Lei Zhu, Shaohua Ma, Irwin King

 - **Abstract**
 Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.
