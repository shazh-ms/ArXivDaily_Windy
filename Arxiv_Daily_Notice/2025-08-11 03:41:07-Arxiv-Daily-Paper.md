 - **Abstract**
 Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing by leveraging audio codecs to discretize audio into tokens, enabling the application of language modeling techniques to speech data. However, existing audio codecs often operate at high frame rates, leading to slow training and inference, particularly for autoregressive models. To address this, there is growing interest in low frame-rate audio codecs, which reduce the number of autoregressive steps required to generate one second of audio. In this paper, we conduct ablation studies to examine the impact of frame rate, bitrate, and causality on codec reconstruction quality. Based on our findings, we introduce NanoCodec, a state-of-the-art audio codec that achieves high-quality compression at just 12.5 frames per second (FPS). NanoCodec outperforms related works across various bitrate ranges, establishing a new benchmark for low-latency and efficient Speech LLM training and inference.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-intrusive speech quality assessment (SQA) systems suffer from limited training data and costly human annotations, hindering their generalization to real-time conferencing calls. In this work, we propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) as pseudo-raters for speech quality to address these data bottlenecks. We construct LibriAugmented, a dataset consisting of 101,129 speech clips with simulated degradations labeled by a fine-tuned auditory LLM (Vicuna-7b-v1.5). We compare three training strategies: using human-labeled data, using LLM-labeled data, and a two-stage approach (pretraining on LLM labels, then fine-tuning on human labels), using both DNSMOS Pro and DeePMOS. We test on several datasets across languages and quality degradations. While LLM-labeled training yields mixed results compared to human-labeled training, we provide empirical evidence that the two-stage approach improves the generalization performance (e.g., DNSMOS Pro achieves 0.63 vs. 0.55 PCC on NISQA_TEST_LIVETALK and 0.73 vs. 0.65 PCC on Tencent with reverb). Our findings demonstrate the potential of using LLMs as scalable pseudo-raters for speech quality assessment, offering a cost-effective solution to the data limitation problem.
#### Egonoise Resilient Source Localization and Speech Enhancement for Drones Using a Hybrid Model and Learning-Based Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Drones are becoming increasingly important in search and rescue missions, and even military operations. While the majority of drones are equipped with camera vision capabilities, the realm of drone audition remains underexplored due to the inherent challenge of mitigating the egonoise generated by the rotors. In this paper, we present a novel technique to address this extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) problem encountered by the microphone-embedded drones. The technique is implemented using a hybrid approach that combines Array Signal Processing (ASP) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to enhance the speech signals captured by a six-microphone uniform circular array mounted on a quadcopter. The system performs localization of the target speaker through beamsteering in conjunction with speech enhancement through a Generalized Sidelobe Canceller-DeepFilterNet 2 (GSC-DF2) system. To validate the system, the DREGON dataset and measured data are employed. Objective evaluations of the proposed hybrid approach demonstrated its superior performance over four baseline methods in the SNR condition as low as -30 dB.
#### Use Cases for Voice Anonymization

 - **Abstract**
 The performance of a voice anonymization system is typically measured according to its ability to hide the speaker's identity and keep the data's utility for downstream tasks. This means that the requirements the anonymization should fulfill depend on the context in which it is used and may differ greatly between use cases. However, these use cases are rarely specified in research papers. In this paper, we study the implications of use case-specific requirements on the design of voice anonymization methods. We perform an extensive literature analysis and user study to collect possible use cases and to understand the expectations of the general public towards such tools. Based on these studies, we propose the first taxonomy of use cases for voice anonymization, and derive a set of requirements and design criteria for method development and evaluation. Using this scheme, we propose to focus more on use case-oriented research and development of voice anonymization systems.
#### Llasa+: Free Lunch for Accelerated and Streaming Llama-Based Speech Synthesis

 - **Abstract**
 Recent progress in text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved impressive naturalness and flexibility, especially with the development of large language model (LLM)-based approaches. However, existing autoregressive (AR) structures and large-scale models, such as Llasa, still face significant challenges in inference latency and streaming synthesis. To deal with the limitations, we introduce Llasa+, an accelerated and streaming TTS model built on Llasa. Specifically, to accelerate the generation process, we introduce two plug-and-play Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) modules following the frozen backbone. These modules allow the model to predict multiple tokens in one AR step. Additionally, to mitigate potential error propagation caused by inaccurate MTP, we design a novel verification algorithm that leverages the frozen backbone to validate the generated tokens, thus allowing Llasa+ to achieve speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Furthermore, we design a causal decoder that enables streaming speech reconstruction from tokens. Extensive experiments show that Llasa+ achieves a 1.48X speedup without sacrificing generation quality, despite being trained only on LibriTTS. Moreover, the MTP-and-verification framework can be applied to accelerate any LLM-based model. All codes and models are publicly available at this https URL.
