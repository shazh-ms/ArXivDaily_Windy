#### Towards Emotionally Consistent Text-Based Speech Editing: Introducing EmoCorrector and The ECD-TSE Dataset
 - **Authors:** Rui Liu, Pu Gao, Jiatian Xi, Berrak Sisman, Carlos Busso, Haizhou Li

 - **Abstract**
 Text-based speech editing (TSE) modifies speech using only text, eliminating re-recording. However, existing TSE methods, mainly focus on the content accuracy and acoustic consistency of synthetic speech segments, and often overlook the emotional shifts or inconsistency issues introduced by text changes. To address this issue, we propose EmoCorrector, a novel post-correction scheme for TSE. EmoCorrector leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by extracting the edited text's emotional features, retrieving speech samples with matching emotions, and synthesizing speech that aligns with the desired emotion while preserving the speaker's identity and quality. To support the training and evaluation of emotional consistency modeling in TSE, we pioneer the benchmarking Emotion Correction Dataset for TSE (ECD-TSE). The prominent aspect of ECD-TSE is its inclusion of $<$text, speech$>$ paired data featuring diverse text variations and a range of emotional expressions. Subjective and objective experiments and comprehensive analysis on ECD-TSE confirm that EmoCorrector significantly enhances the expression of intended emotion while addressing emotion inconsistency limitations in current TSE methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has advanced with Speech Foundation Models (SFMs), yet performance degrades on dysarthric speech due to variability and limited data. This study as part of the submission to the Speech Accessibility challenge, explored model merging to improve ASR generalization using Whisper as the base SFM. We compared fine-tuning with single-trajectory merging, combining models from one fine-tuning path, and multi-run merging, merging independently trained models. Our best multi-run merging approach achieved a 12% relative decrease of WER over classic fine-tuning, and a 16.2% relative decrease on long-form audios, a major loss contributor in dysarthric ASR. Merging more and more models led to continuous gains, remained effective in low-data regimes, and generalized across model architectures. These results highlight model merging as an easily replicable adaptation method that consistently improves ASR without additional inference cost or hyperparameter tuning.

 - **Abstract**
 Early suicide risk detection in adolescents is critical yet hindered by scalability challenges of current assessments. This paper presents our approach to the first SpeechWellness Challenge (SW1), which aims to assess suicide risk in Chinese adolescents through speech analysis. Due to speech anonymization constraints, we focused on linguistic features, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for transcript-based classification. Using DSPy for systematic prompt engineering, we developed a robust in-context learning approach that outperformed traditional fine-tuning on both linguistic and acoustic markers. Our systems achieved third and fourth places among 180+ submissions, with 0.68 accuracy (F1=0.7) using only transcripts. Ablation analyses showed that increasing prompt example improved performance (p=0.003), with varying effects across model types and sizes. These findings advance automated suicide risk assessment and demonstrate LLMs' value in mental health applications.
#### ReverbFX: A Dataset of Room Impulse Responses Derived from Reverb Effect Plugins for Singing Voice Dereverberation
 - **Authors:** Julius Richter, Till Svajda, Timo Gerkmann
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20533

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20533

 - **Abstract**
 We present ReverbFX, a new room impulse response (RIR) dataset designed for singing voice dereverberation research. Unlike existing datasets based on real recorded RIRs, ReverbFX features a diverse collection of RIRs captured from various reverb audio effect plugins commonly used in music production. We conduct comprehensive experiments using the proposed dataset to benchmark the challenge of dereverberation of singing voice recordings affected by artificial reverbs. We train two state-of-the-art generative models using ReverbFX and demonstrate that models trained with plugin-derived RIRs outperform those trained on realistic RIRs in artificial reverb scenarios.
#### Plug-and-Play Co-Occurring Face Attention for Robust Audio-Visual Speaker Extraction
 - **Authors:** Zexu Pan, Shengkui Zhao, Tingting Wang, Kun Zhou, Yukun Ma, Chong Zhang, Bin Ma

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20635

 - **Abstract**
 Audio-visual speaker extraction isolates a target speaker's speech from a mixture speech signal conditioned on a visual cue, typically using the target speaker's face recording. However, in real-world scenarios, other co-occurring faces are often present on-screen, providing valuable speaker activity cues in the scene. In this work, we introduce a plug-and-play inter-speaker attention module to process these flexible numbers of co-occurring faces, allowing for more accurate speaker extraction in complex multi-person environments. We integrate our module into two prominent models: the AV-DPRNN and the state-of-the-art AV-TFGridNet. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including the highly overlapped VoxCeleb2 and sparsely overlapped MISP, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations on LRS2 and LRS3 confirm the robustness and generalizability of our method.
#### PromptEVC: Controllable Emotional Voice Conversion with Natural Language Prompts

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20678

 - **Abstract**
 Controllable emotional voice conversion (EVC) aims to manipulate emotional expressions to increase the diversity of synthesized speech. Existing methods typically rely on predefined labels, reference audios, or prespecified factor values, often overlooking individual differences in emotion perception and expression. In this paper, we introduce PromptEVC that utilizes natural language prompts for precise and flexible emotion control. To bridge text descriptions with emotional speech, we propose emotion descriptor and prompt mapper to generate fine-grained emotion embeddings, trained jointly with reference embeddings. To enhance naturalness, we present a prosody modeling and control pipeline that adjusts the rhythm based on linguistic content and emotional cues. Additionally, a speaker encoder is incorporated to preserve identity. Experimental results demonstrate that PromptEVC outperforms state-of-the-art controllable EVC methods in emotion conversion, intensity control, mixed emotion synthesis, and prosody manipulation.

#### REWIND: Speech Time Reversal for Enhancing Speaker Representations in Diffusion-based Voice Conversion
 - **Authors:** Ishan D. Biyani, Nirmesh J. Shah, Ashishkumar P. Gudmalwar, Pankaj Wasnik, Rajiv R. Shah

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20756

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20756

 - **Abstract**
 Speech time reversal refers to the process of reversing the entire speech signal in time, causing it to play backward. Such signals are completely unintelligible since the fundamental structures of phonemes and syllables are destroyed. However, they still retain tonal patterns that enable perceptual speaker identification despite losing linguistic content. In this paper, we propose leveraging speaker representations learned from time reversed speech as an augmentation strategy to enhance speaker representation. Notably, speaker and language disentanglement in voice conversion (VC) is essential to accurately preserve a speaker's unique vocal traits while minimizing interference from linguistic content. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in the context of state-of-the-art diffusion-based VC models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves speaker similarity-related scores while maintaining high speech quality.
#### Study of Lightweight Transformer Architectures for Single-Channel Speech Enhancement

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21057

 - **Abstract**
 In speech enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art (SotA) performance while adhering to the computational constraints on edge devices remains a formidable challenge. Networks integrating stacked temporal and spectral modelling effectively leverage improved architectures such as transformers; however, they inevitably incur substantial computational complexity and model expansion. Through systematic ablation analysis on transformer-based temporal and spectral modelling, we demonstrate that the architecture employing streamlined Frequency-Time-Frequency (FTF) stacked transformers efficiently learns global dependencies within causal context, while avoiding considerable computational demands. Utilising discriminators in training further improves learning efficacy and enhancement without introducing additional complexity during inference. The proposed lightweight, causal, transformer-based architecture with adversarial training (LCT-GAN) yields SoTA performance on instrumental metrics among contemporary lightweight models, but with far less overhead. Compared to DeepFilterNet2, the LCT-GAN only requires 6% of the parameters, at similar complexity and performance. Against CCFNet+(Lite), LCT-GAN saves 9% in parameters and 10% in multiply-accumulate operations yet yielding improved performance. Further, the LCT-GAN even outperforms more complex, common baseline models on widely used test datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of speech in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a powerful tool to support clinicians in the assessment of bulbar dysfunction. However, current methods used in clinical practice consist of subjective evaluations or expensive instrumentation. This study investigates different approaches combining audio-visual analysis and machine learning to predict the speech impairment evaluation performed by clinicians. Using a small dataset of acoustic and kinematic features extracted from audio and video recordings of speech tasks, we trained and tested some regression models. The best performance was achieved using the extreme boosting machine regressor with multimodal features, which resulted in a root mean squared error of 0.93 on a scale ranging from 5 to 25. Results suggest that integrating audio-video analysis enhances speech impairment assessment, providing an objective tool for early detection and monitoring of bulbar dysfunction, also in home settings.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21230

 - **Abstract**
 Although Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become an integral part of modern technology, their evaluation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper introduces Persian Speech Recognition Benchmark(PSRB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to address this gap by incorporating diverse linguistic and acoustic conditions. We evaluate ten ASR systems, including state-of-the-art commercial and open-source models, to examine performance variations and inherent biases. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Persian ASR transcriptions, identifying key error types and proposing a novel metric that weights substitution errors. This metric enhances evaluation robustness by reducing the impact of minor and partial errors, thereby improving the precision of performance assessment. Our findings indicate that while ASR models generally perform well on standard Persian, they struggle with regional accents, children's speech, and specific linguistic challenges. These results highlight the necessity of fine-tuning and incorporating diverse, representative training datasets to mitigate biases and enhance overall ASR performance. PSRB provides a valuable resource for advancing ASR research in Persian and serves as a framework for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages. A subset of the PSRB dataset is publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20506

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20506

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce ArVoice, a multi-speaker Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) speech corpus with diacritized transcriptions, intended for multi-speaker speech synthesis, and can be useful for other tasks such as speech-based diacritic restoration, voice conversion, and deepfake detection. ArVoice comprises: (1) a new professionally recorded set from six voice talents with diverse demographics, (2) a modified subset of the Arabic Speech Corpus; and (3) high-quality synthetic speech from two commercial systems. The complete corpus consists of a total of 83.52 hours of speech across 11 voices; around 10 hours consist of human voices from 7 speakers. We train three open-source TTS and two voice conversion systems to illustrate the use cases of the dataset. The corpus is available for research use.
#### Training Articulatory Inversion Models for Inter-Speaker Consistency

Sound (cs.SD); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20529

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20529

 - **Abstract**
 Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion (AAI) attempts to model the inverse mapping from speech to articulation. Exact articulatory prediction from speech alone may be impossible, as speakers can choose different forms of articulation seemingly without reference to their vocal tract structure. However, once a speaker has selected an articulatory form, their productions vary minimally. Recent works in AAI have proposed adapting Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models to single-speaker datasets, claiming that these single-speaker models provide a universal articulatory template. In this paper, we investigate whether SSL-adapted models trained on single and multi-speaker data produce articulatory targets which are consistent across speaker identities for English and Russian. We do this through the use of a novel evaluation method which extracts articulatory targets using minimal pair sets. We also present a training method which can improve inter-speaker consistency using only speech data.
#### Phir Hera Fairy: An English Fairytaler is a Strong Faker of Fluent Speech in Low-Resource Indian Languages
 - **Authors:** Praveen Srinivasa Varadhan, Srija Anand, Soma Siddhartha, Mitesh M.Khapra

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20693

 - **Abstract**
 What happens when an English Fairytaler is fine-tuned on Indian languages? We evaluate how the English F5-TTS model adapts to 11 Indian languages, measuring polyglot fluency, voice-cloning, style-cloning, and code-mixing. We compare: (i) training from scratch, (ii) fine-tuning English F5 on Indian data, and (iii) fine-tuning on both Indian and English data to prevent forgetting. Fine-tuning with only Indian data proves most effective and the resultant IN-F5 is a near-human polyglot; that enables speakers of one language (e.g., Odia) to fluently speak in another (e.g., Hindi). Our results show English pretraining aids low-resource TTS in reaching human parity. To aid progress in other low-resource languages, we study data-constrained setups and arrive at a compute optimal strategy. Finally, we show IN-F5 can synthesize unseen languages like Bhojpuri and Tulu using a human-in-the-loop approach for zero-resource TTS via synthetic data generation.
#### Uni-VERSA: Versatile Speech Assessment with a Unified Network

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20741

 - **Abstract**
 Subjective listening tests remain the golden standard for speech quality assessment, but are costly, variable, and difficult to scale. In contrast, existing objective metrics, such as PESQ, F0 correlation, and DNSMOS, typically capture only specific aspects of speech quality. To address these limitations, we introduce Uni-VERSA, a unified network that simultaneously predicts various objective metrics, encompassing naturalness, intelligibility, speaker characteristics, prosody, and noise, for a comprehensive evaluation of speech signals. We formalize its framework, evaluation protocol, and applications in speech enhancement, synthesis, and quality control. A benchmark based on the URGENT24 challenge, along with a baseline leveraging self-supervised representations, demonstrates that Uni-VERSA provides a viable alternative to single-aspect evaluation methods. Moreover, it aligns closely with human perception, making it a promising approach for future speech quality assessment.

 - **Abstract**
 In music production, manipulating audio effects (Fx) parameters through natural language has the potential to reduce technical barriers for non-experts. We present LLM2Fx, a framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict Fx parameters directly from textual descriptions without requiring task-specific training or fine-tuning. Our approach address the text-to-effect parameter prediction (Text2Fx) task by mapping natural language descriptions to the corresponding Fx parameters for equalization and reverberation. We demonstrate that LLMs can generate Fx parameters in a zero-shot manner that elucidates the relationship between timbre semantics and audio effects in music production. To enhance performance, we introduce three types of in-context examples: audio Digital Signal Processing (DSP) features, DSP function code, and few-shot examples. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based Fx parameter generation outperforms previous optimization approaches, offering competitive performance in translating natural language descriptions to appropriate Fx settings. Furthermore, LLMs can serve as text-driven interfaces for audio production, paving the way for more intuitive and accessible music production tools.
#### VibE-SVC: Vibrato Extraction with High-frequency F0 Contour for Singing Voice Conversion
 - **Authors:** Joon-Seung Choi, Dong-Min Byun, Hyung-Seok Oh, Seong-Whan Lee

Sound (cs.SD); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20794

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20794

 - **Abstract**
 Controlling singing style is crucial for achieving an expressive and natural singing voice. Among the various style factors, vibrato plays a key role in conveying emotions and enhancing musical depth. However, modeling vibrato remains challenging due to its dynamic nature, making it difficult to control in singing voice conversion. To address this, we propose VibESVC, a controllable singing voice conversion model that explicitly extracts and manipulates vibrato using discrete wavelet transform. Unlike previous methods that model vibrato implicitly, our approach decomposes the F0 contour into frequency components, enabling precise transfer. This allows vibrato control for enhanced flexibility. Experimental results show that VibE-SVC effectively transforms singing styles while preserving speaker similarity. Both subjective and objective evaluations confirm high-quality conversion.
#### Spotlight-TTS: Spotlighting the Style via Voiced-Aware Style Extraction and Style Direction Adjustment for Expressive Text-to-Speech

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20868

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in expressive text-to-speech (TTS) have introduced diverse methods based on style embedding extracted from reference speech. However, synthesizing high-quality expressive speech remains challenging. We propose Spotlight-TTS, which exclusively emphasizes style via voiced-aware style extraction and style direction adjustment. Voiced-aware style extraction focuses on voiced regions highly related to style while maintaining continuity across different speech regions to improve expressiveness. We adjust the direction of the extracted style for optimal integration into the TTS model, which improves speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that Spotlight-TTS achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in terms of expressiveness, overall speech quality, and style transfer capability. Our audio samples are publicly available.
#### Dub-S2ST: Textless Speech-to-Speech Translation for Seamless Dubbing
 - **Authors:** Jeongsoo Choi, Jaehun Kim, Joon Son Chung
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20899

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20899

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces a cross-lingual dubbing system that translates speech from one language to another while preserving key characteristics such as duration, speaker identity, and speaking speed. Despite the strong translation quality of existing speech translation approaches, they often overlook the transfer of speech patterns, leading to mismatches with source speech and limiting their suitability for dubbing applications. To address this, we propose a discrete diffusion-based speech-to-unit translation model with explicit duration control, enabling time-aligned translation. We then synthesize speech based on the predicted units and source identity with a conditional flow matching model. Additionally, we introduce a unit-based speed adaptation mechanism that guides the translation model to produce speech at a rate consistent with the source, without relying on any text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates natural and fluent translations that align with the original speech's duration and speaking pace, while achieving competitive translation performance.
#### Scaling and Prompting for Improved End-to-End Spoken Grammatical Error Correction

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21137

 - **Abstract**
 Spoken Grammatical Error Correction (SGEC) and Feedback (SGECF) are crucial for second language learners, teachers and test takers. Traditional SGEC systems rely on a cascaded pipeline consisting of an ASR, a module for disfluency detection (DD) and removal and one for GEC. With the rise of end-to-end (E2E) speech foundation models, we investigate their effectiveness in SGEC and feedback generation. This work introduces a pseudo-labelling process to address the challenge of limited labelled data, expanding the training data size from 77 hours to approximately 2500 hours, leading to improved performance. Additionally, we prompt an E2E Whisper-based SGEC model with fluent transcriptions, showing a slight improvement in SGEC performance, with more significant gains in feedback generation. Finally, we assess the impact of increasing model size, revealing that while pseudo-labelled data does not yield performance gain for a larger Whisper model, training with prompts proves beneficial.
#### Leveraging LLM and Self-Supervised Training Models for Speech Recognition in Chinese Dialects: A Comparative Analysis

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21138

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale training corpora have significantly improved the performance of ASR models. Unfortunately, due to the relative scarcity of data, Chinese accents and dialects remain a challenge for most ASR models. Recent advancements in self-supervised learning have shown that self-supervised pre- training, combined with large language models (LLM), can effectively enhance ASR performance in low-resource scenarios. We aim to investigate the effectiveness of this paradigm for Chinese dialects. Specifically, we pre-train a Data2vec2 model on 300,000 hours of unlabeled dialect and accented speech data and do alignment training on a supervised dataset of 40,000 hours. Then, we systematically examine the impact of various projectors and LLMs on Mandarin, dialect, and accented speech recognition performance under this paradigm. Our method achieved SOTA results on multiple dialect datasets, including Kespeech. We will open-source our work to promote reproducible research
#### Assessment of L2 Oral Proficiency using Speech Large Language Models

 - **Abstract**
 The growing population of L2 English speakers has increased the demand for developing automatic graders for spoken language assessment (SLA). Historically, statistical models, text encoders, and self-supervised speech models have been utilised for this task. However, cascaded systems suffer from the loss of information, while E2E graders also have limitations. With the recent advancements of multi-modal large language models (LLMs), we aim to explore their potential as L2 oral proficiency graders and overcome these issues. In this work, we compare various training strategies using regression and classification targets. Our results show that speech LLMs outperform all previous competitive baselines, achieving superior performance on two datasets. Furthermore, the trained grader demonstrates strong generalisation capabilities in the cross-part or cross-task evaluation, facilitated by the audio understanding knowledge acquired during LLM pre-training.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21156

 - **Abstract**
 Conventional methods for speech enhancement rely on handcrafted loss functions (e.g., time or frequency domain losses) or deep feature losses (e.g., using WavLM or wav2vec), which often fail to capture subtle signal properties essential for optimal performance. To address this, we propose Model as Loss, a novel training paradigm that utilizes the encoder from the same model as a loss function to guide the training. The Model as Loss paradigm leverages the encoder's task-specific feature space, optimizing the decoder to produce output consistent with perceptual and task-relevant characteristics of the clean signal. By using the encoder's learned features as a loss function, this framework enforces self-consistency between the clean reference speech and the enhanced model output. Our approach outperforms pre-trained deep feature losses on standard speech enhancement benchmarks, offering better perceptual quality and robust generalization to both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Topological data analysis (TDA) offers novel mathematical tools for deep learning. Inspired by Carlsson et al., this study designs topology-aware convolutional kernels that significantly improve speech recognition networks. Theoretically, by investigating orthogonal group actions on kernels, we establish a fiber-bundle decomposition of matrix spaces, enabling new filter generation methods. Practically, our proposed Orthogonal Feature (OF) layer achieves superior performance in phoneme recognition, particularly in low-noise scenarios, while demonstrating cross-domain adaptability. This work reveals TDA's potential in neural network optimization, opening new avenues for mathematics-deep learning interdisciplinary studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge aimed to advance universal, robust, and generalizable speech enhancement by unifying speech enhancement tasks across a wide variety of conditions, including seven different distortion types and five languages. We present Universal Speech Enhancement Mamba (USEMamba), a state-space speech enhancement model designed to handle long-range sequence modeling, time-frequency structured processing, and sampling frequency-independent feature extraction. Our approach primarily relies on regression-based modeling, which performs well across most distortions. However, for packet loss and bandwidth extension, where missing content must be inferred, a generative variant of the proposed USEMamba proves more effective. Despite being trained on only a subset of the full training data, USEMamba achieved 2nd place in Track 1 during the blind test phase, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a novel memory-efficient model compression approach for Conformer ASR and speech foundation systems. Our approach features a unique "small-to-large" design. A compact "seed" model containing a few Conformer or Transformer blocks is trained and unfolded many times to emulate the performance of larger uncompressed models with different logical depths. The seed model and many unfolded paths are jointly trained within a single unfolding cycle. The KL-divergence between the largest unfolded and smallest seed models is used in a self-distillation process to minimize their performance disparity. Experimental results show that our foldable model produces ASR performance comparable to individually constructed Conformer and wav2vec2/HuBERT speech foundation models under various depth configurations, while requiring only minimal memory and storage. Conformer and wav2vec2 models with a reduction of 35% and 30% parameters are obtained without loss of performance, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Model compression has become an emerging need as the sizes of modern speech systems rapidly increase. In this paper, we study model weight quantization, which directly reduces the memory footprint to accommodate computationally resource-constrained applications. We propose novel approaches to perform extremely low-bit (i.e., 2-bit and 1-bit) quantization of Conformer automatic speech recognition systems using multiple precision model co-training, stochastic precision, and tensor-wise learnable scaling factors to alleviate quantization incurred performance loss. The proposed methods can achieve performance-lossless 2-bit and 1-bit quantization of Conformer ASR systems trained with the 300-hr Switchboard and 960-hr LibriSpeech corpus. Maximum overall performance-lossless compression ratios of 16.2 and 16.6 times are achieved without a statistically significant increase in the word error rate (WER) over the full precision baseline systems, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Objective: Perceptual voice quality assessment plays a critical role in diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders by providing standardized evaluation of vocal function. Traditionally, this process relies on expert raters utilizing standard scales, such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS). However, these metrics are inherently subjective and susceptible to inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated and objective assessment methods. Methods: We propose Voice Quality Assessment Network (VOQANet), a deep learning-based framework with an attention mechanism that leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to capture high-level acoustic and prosodic information from raw speech. To enhance robustness and interpretability, we present VOQANet+, which integrates handcrafted acoustic features such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM embeddings. Results: Sentence-based input yields stronger performance than vowel-based input, especially at the patient level. VOQANet consistently outperforms baseline methods in RMSE and PCC, while VOQANet+ performs even better and maintains robustness under noisy conditions. Conclusion: Combining SFM embeddings with domain-informed acoustic features improves interpretability and resilience. Significance: VOQANet+ shows strong potential for deployment in real-world and telehealth settings, addressing the limitations of subjective perceptual assessments with an interpretable and noise-resilient solution.
