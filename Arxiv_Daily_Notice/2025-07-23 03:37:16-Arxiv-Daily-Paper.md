#### Distributed Asynchronous Device Speech Enhancement via Windowed Cross-Attention
 - **Authors:** Gene-Ping Yang, Sebastian Braun

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing number of microphone-equipped personal devices offers great flexibility and potential using them as ad-hoc microphone arrays in dynamic meeting environments. However, most existing approaches are designed for time-synchronized microphone setups, a condition that may not hold in real-world meeting scenarios, where time latency and clock drift vary across devices. Under such conditions, we found transform-average-concatenate (TAC), a popular module for neural multi-microphone processing, insufficient in handling time-asynchronous microphones. In response, we propose a windowed cross-attention module capable of dynamically aligning features between all microphones. This module is invariant to both the permutation and the number of microphones and can be easily integrated into existing models. Furthermore, we propose an optimal training target for multi-talker environments. We evaluated our approach in a multi-microphone noisy reverberant setup with unknown time latency and clock drift of each microphone. Experimental results show that our method outperforms TAC on both iFaSNet and CRUSE models, offering faster convergence and improved learning, demonstrating the efficacy of the windowed cross-attention module for asynchronous microphone setups.

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) plays a crucial role in human-machine interaction and serves as an interface for a wide range of applications. Traditionally, ASR performance has been evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER), a metric that quantifies the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions in the generated transcriptions. However, with the increasing adoption of large and powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core processing component in various applications, the significance of different types of ASR errors in downstream tasks warrants further exploration. In this work, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to correct errors introduced by ASRs and propose a new measure to evaluate ASR performance for LLM-powered applications.
#### Nonlinear Framework for Speech Bandwidth Extension

 - **Abstract**
 Recovering high-frequency components lost to bandwidth constraints is crucial for applications ranging from telecommunications to high-fidelity audio on limited resources. We introduce NDSI-BWE, a new adversarial Band Width Extension (BWE) framework that leverage four new discriminators inspired by nonlinear dynamical system to capture diverse temporal behaviors: a Multi-Resolution Lyapunov Discriminator (MRLD) for determining sensitivity to initial conditions by capturing deterministic chaos, a Multi-Scale Recurrence Discriminator (MS-RD) for self-similar recurrence dynamics, a Multi-Scale Detrended Fractal Analysis Discriminator (MSDFA) for long range slow variant scale invariant relationship, a Multi-Resolution PoincarÃ© Plot Discriminator (MR-PPD) for capturing hidden latent space relationship, a Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD) for cyclical patterns, a Multi-Resolution Amplitude Discriminator (MRAD) and Multi-Resolution Phase Discriminator (MRPD) for capturing intricate amplitude-phase transition statistics. By using depth-wise convolution at the core of the convolutional block with in each discriminators, NDSI-BWE attains an eight-times parameter reduction. These seven discriminators guide a complex-valued ConformerNeXt based genetor with a dual stream Lattice-Net based architecture for simultaneous refinement of magnitude and phase. The genertor leverage the transformer based conformer's global dependency modeling and ConvNeXt block's local temporal modeling capability. Across six objective evaluation metrics and subjective based texts comprises of five human judges, NDSI-BWE establishes a new SoTA in BWE.
#### LABNet: A Lightweight Attentive Beamforming Network for Ad-hoc Multichannel Microphone Invariant Real-Time Speech Enhancement
 - **Authors:** Haoyin Yan, Jie Zhang, Chengqian Jiang, Shuang Zhang
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16190

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16190

 - **Abstract**
 Multichannel speech enhancement (SE) aims to restore clean speech from noisy measurements by leveraging spatiotemporal signal features. In ad-hoc array conditions, microphone invariance (MI) requires systems to handle different microphone numbers and array geometries. From a practical perspective, multichannel recordings inevitably increase the computational burden for edge-device applications, highlighting the necessity of lightweight and efficient deployments. In this work, we propose a lightweight attentive beamforming network (LABNet) to integrate MI in a low-complexity real-time SE system. We design a three-stage framework for efficient intra-channel modeling and inter-channel interaction. A cross-channel attention module is developed to aggregate features from each channel selectively. Experimental results demonstrate our LABNet achieves impressive performance with ultra-light resource overhead while maintaining the MI, indicating great potential for ad-hoc array processing.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents Step-Audio~2, an end-to-end multi-modal large language model designed for industry-strength audio understanding and speech conversation. By integrating a latent audio encoder and reasoning-centric reinforcement learning (RL), Step-Audio 2 achieves promising performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio understanding. To facilitate genuine end-to-end speech conversation, Step-Audio 2 incorporates the generation of discrete audio tokens into language modeling, significantly enhancing its responsiveness to paralinguistic information such as speaking styles and emotions. To effectively leverage the rich textual and acoustic knowledge in real-world data, Step-Audio 2 integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and is able to call external tools such as web search to mitigate hallucination and audio search to switch timbres. Trained on millions of hours of speech and audio data, Step-Audio 2 delivers intelligence and expressiveness across diverse conversational scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various audio understanding and conversational benchmarks compared to other open-source and commercial solutions.
