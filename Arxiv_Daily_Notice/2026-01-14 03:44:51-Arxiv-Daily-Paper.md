#### LJ-Spoof: A Generatively Varied Corpus for Audio Anti-Spoofing and Synthesis Source Tracing
 - **Authors:** Surya Subramani, Hashim Ali, Hafiz Malik
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07958

 - **Abstract**
 Speaker-specific anti-spoofing and synthesis-source tracing are central challenges in audio anti-spoofing. Progress has been hampered by the lack of datasets that systematically vary model architectures, synthesis pipelines, and generative parameters. To address this gap, we introduce LJ-Spoof, a speaker-specific, generatively diverse corpus that systematically varies prosody, vocoders, generative hyperparameters, bona fide prompt sources, training regimes, and neural post-processing. The corpus spans one speakers-including studio-quality recordings-30 TTS families, 500 generatively variant subsets, 10 bona fide neural-processing variants, and more than 3 million utterances. This variation-dense design enables robust speaker-conditioned anti-spoofing and fine-grained synthesis-source tracing. We further position this dataset as both a practical reference training resource and a benchmark evaluation suite for anti-spoofing and source tracing.
#### VoxCog: Towards End-to-End Multilingual Cognitive Impairment Classification through Dialectal Knowledge
 - **Authors:** Tiantian Feng, Anfeng Xu, Jinkook Lee, Shrikanth Narayanan
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a novel perspective on cognitive impairment classification from speech by integrating speech foundation models that explicitly recognize speech dialects. Our motivation is based on the observation that individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often produce measurable speech characteristics, such as slower articulation rate and lengthened sounds, in a manner similar to dialectal phonetic variations seen in speech. Building on this idea, we introduce VoxCog, an end-to-end framework that uses pre-trained dialect models to detect AD or MCI without relying on additional modalities such as text or images. Through experiments on multiple multilingual datasets for AD and MCI detection, we demonstrate that model initialization with a dialect classifier on top of speech foundation models consistently improves the predictive performance of AD or MCI. Our trained models yield similar or often better performance compared to previous approaches that ensembled several computational methods using different signal modalities. Particularly, our end-to-end speech-based model achieves 87.5% and 85.9% accuracy on the ADReSS 2020 challenge and ADReSSo 2021 challenge test sets, outperforming existing solutions that use multimodal ensemble-based computation or LLMs.
#### Decoding Order Matters in Autoregressive Speech Synthesis
 - **Authors:** Minghui Zhao, Anton Ragni
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08450

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08450

 - **Abstract**
 Autoregressive speech synthesis often adopts a left-to-right order, yet generation order is a modelling choice. We investigate decoding order through masked diffusion framework, which progressively unmasks positions and allows arbitrary decoding orders during training and inference. By interpolating between identity and random permutations, we show that randomness in decoding order affects speech quality. We further compare fixed strategies, such as \texttt{l2r} and \texttt{r2l} with adaptive ones, such as Top-$K$, finding that fixed-order decoding, including the dominating left-to-right approach, is suboptimal, while adaptive decoding yields better performance. Finally, since masked diffusion requires discrete inputs, we quantise acoustic representations and find that even 1-bit quantisation can support reasonably high-quality speech.
#### Robust CAPTCHA Using Audio Illusions in the Era of Large Language Models: from Evaluation to Advances

 - **Abstract**
 CAPTCHAs are widely used by websites to block bots and spam by presenting challenges that are easy for humans but difficult for automated programs to solve. To improve accessibility, audio CAPTCHAs are designed to complement visual ones. However, the robustness of audio CAPTCHAs against advanced Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce AI-CAPTCHA, a unified framework that offers (i) an evaluation framework, ACEval, which includes advanced LALM- and ASR-based solvers, and (ii) a novel audio CAPTCHA approach, IllusionAudio, leveraging audio illusions. Through extensive evaluations of seven widely deployed audio CAPTCHAs, we show that most existing methods can be solved with high success rates by advanced LALMs and ASR models, exposing critical security weaknesses. To address these vulnerabilities, we design a new audio CAPTCHA approach, IllusionAudio, which exploits perceptual illusion cues rooted in human auditory mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method defeats all tested LALM- and ASR-based attacks while achieving a 100% human pass rate, significantly outperforming existing audio CAPTCHA methods.
