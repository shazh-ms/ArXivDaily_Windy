 - **Abstract**
 Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise' classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the architecture and performance of a novel Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system developed by the Transsion Speech Team for Track 1 of the MLC-SLM 2025 Challenge. The proposed system comprises three key components: 1) a frozen Whisper-large-v3 based speech encoder, leveraging large-scale pretraining to ensure robust acoustic feature extraction; 2) a trainable adaptor module using Linear-ReLU-Linear transformation mechanisms to effectively align speech and text representations; and 3) a frozen Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct large language model (LLM) integrated with trainable LoRA for optimized contextual linguistic decoding. By systematically combining pretrained models with task specific fine-tuning, the system achieved a word/character error rate (WER/CER) of 9.83% across 11 languages in the evaluation set and ranked third place among global participants.
#### Mitigating Hallucinations in LM-Based TTS Models via Distribution Alignment Using GFlowNets
 - **Authors:** Chenlin Liu, Minghui Fang, Patrick Zhang, Wei Zhou, Jie Gao, Jiqing Han
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Sound (cs.SD)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15442

 - **Abstract**
 Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost. Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.
#### EffortNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Objective Assessment of Speech Enhancement Technologies Using EEG-Based Alpha Oscillations

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents EffortNet, a novel deep learning framework for decoding individual listening effort from electroencephalography (EEG) during speech comprehension. Listening effort represents a significant challenge in speech-hearing research, particularly for aging populations and those with hearing impairment. We collected 64-channel EEG data from 122 participants during speech comprehension under four conditions: clean, noisy, MMSE-enhanced, and Transformer-enhanced speech. Statistical analyses confirmed that alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) exhibited significantly higher power during noisy speech processing compared to clean or enhanced conditions, confirming their validity as objective biomarkers of listening effort. To address the substantial inter-individual variability in EEG signals, EffortNet integrates three complementary learning paradigms: self-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data, incremental learning for progressive adaptation to individual characteristics, and transfer learning for efficient knowledge transfer to new subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that Effort- Net achieves 80.9% classification accuracy with only 40% training data from new subjects, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (62.3%) and STAnet (61.1%) models. The probability-based metric derived from our model revealed that Transformer-enhanced speech elicited neural responses more similar to clean speech than MMSEenhanced speech. This finding contrasted with subjective intelligibility ratings but aligned with objective metrics. The proposed framework provides a practical solution for personalized assessment of hearing technologies, with implications for designing cognitive-aware speech enhancement systems.
#### Human Feedback Driven Dynamic Speech Emotion Recognition
 - **Authors:** Ilya Fedorov, Dmitry Korobchenko
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Sound (cs.SD); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14920

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14920

 - **Abstract**
 This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution. The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified annotation procedure.
#### UniCoM: A Universal Code-Switching Speech Generator
 - **Authors:** Sangmin Lee, Woojin Chung, Seyun Um, Hong-Goo Kang
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15244

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15244

 - **Abstract**
 Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual systems.
#### CUPE: Contextless Universal Phoneme Encoder for Language-Agnostic Speech Processing
 - **Authors:** Abdul Rehman, Jian-Jun Zhang, Xiaosong Yang
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15316

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15316

 - **Abstract**
 Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length windows.
