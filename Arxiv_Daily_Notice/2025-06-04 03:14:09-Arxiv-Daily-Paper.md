#### No Audiogram: Leveraging Existing Scores for Personalized Speech Intelligibility Prediction

 - **Abstract**
 Personalized speech intelligibility prediction is challenging. Previous approaches have mainly relied on audiograms, which are inherently limited in accuracy as they only capture a listener's hearing threshold for pure tones. Rather than incorporating additional listener features, we propose a novel approach that leverages an individual's existing intelligibility data to predict their performance on new audio. We introduce the Support Sample-Based Intelligibility Prediction Network (SSIPNet), a deep learning model that leverages speech foundation models to build a high-dimensional representation of a listener's speech recognition ability from multiple support (audio, score) pairs, enabling accurate predictions for unseen audio. Results on the Clarity Prediction Challenge dataset show that, even with a small number of support (audio, score) pairs, our method outperforms audiogram-based predictions. Our work presents a new paradigm for personalized speech intelligibility prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 Speech impairments are prevalent biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease (PD), motivating the development of diagnostic techniques using speech data for clinical applications. Although deep acoustic features have shown promise for PD classification, their effectiveness often varies due to individual speaker differences, a factor that has not been thoroughly explored in the existing literature. This study investigates the effectiveness of three pre-trained audio embeddings (OpenL3, VGGish and Wav2Vec2.0 models) for PD classification. Using the NeuroVoz dataset, OpenL3 outperforms others in diadochokinesis (DDK) and listen and repeat (LR) tasks, capturing critical acoustic features for PD detection. Only Wav2Vec2.0 shows significant gender bias, achieving more favorable results for male speakers, in DDK tasks. The misclassified cases reveal challenges with atypical speech patterns, highlighting the need for improved feature extraction and model robustness in PD detection.
#### Enhancing GOP in CTC-Based Mispronunciation Detection with Phonological Knowledge
 - **Authors:** Aditya Kamlesh Parikh, Cristian Tejedor-Garcia, Catia Cucchiarini, Helmer Strik

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02080

 - **Abstract**
 Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems employ automatic measures of pronunciation quality, such as the goodness of pronunciation (GOP) metric. GOP relies on forced alignments, which are prone to labeling and segmentation errors due to acoustic variability. While alignment-free methods address these challenges, they are computationally expensive and scale poorly with phoneme sequence length and inventory size. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a substitution-aware alignment-free GOP that restricts phoneme substitutions based on phoneme clusters and common learner errors. We evaluated our GOP on two L2 English speech datasets, one with child speech, My Pronunciation Coach (MPC), and SpeechOcean762, which includes child and adult speech. We compared RPS (restricted phoneme substitutions) and UPS (unrestricted phoneme substitutions) setups within alignment-free methods, which outperformed the baseline. We discuss our results and outline avenues for future research.
#### Dhvani: A Weakly-supervised Phonemic Error Detection and Personalized Feedback System for Hindi
 - **Authors:** Arnav Rustagi, Satvik Bajpai, Nimrat Kaur, Siddharth Siddharth
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02166

 - **Abstract**
 Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) has been extensively studied for English. However, there remains a critical gap in its application to Indian languages with a base of 1.5 billion speakers. Pronunciation tools tailored to Indian languages are strikingly lacking despite the fact that millions learn them every year. With over 600 million speakers and being the fourth most-spoken language worldwide, improving Hindi pronunciation is a vital first step toward addressing this gap. This paper proposes 1) Dhvani -- a novel CAPT system for Hindi, 2) synthetic speech generation for Hindi mispronunciations, and 3) a novel methodology for providing personalized feedback to learners. While the system often interacts with learners using Devanagari graphemes, its core analysis targets phonemic distinctions, leveraging Hindi's highly phonetic orthography to analyze mispronounced speech and provide targeted feedback.
#### Towards Machine Unlearning for Paralinguistic Speech Processing
 - **Authors:** Orchid Chetia Phukan, Girish, Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Shubham Singh, Swarup Ranjan Behera, Vandana Rajan, Muskaan Singh, Arun Balaji Buduru, Rajesh Sharma

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02230

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we pioneer the study of Machine Unlearning (MU) for Paralinguistic Speech Processing (PSP). We focus on two key PSP tasks: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Depression Detection (DD). To this end, we propose, SISA++, a novel extension to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) MU method, SISA by merging models trained on different shards with weight-averaging. With such modifications, we show that SISA++ preserves performance more in comparison to SISA after unlearning in benchmark SER (CREMA-D) and DD (E-DAIC) datasets. Also, to guide future research for easier adoption of MU for PSP, we present ``cookbook recipes'' - actionable recommendations for selecting optimal feature representations and downstream architectures that can mitigate performance degradation after the unlearning process.
#### Investigating the Reasonable Effectiveness of Speaker Pre-Trained Models and their Synergistic Power for SingMOS Prediction
 - **Authors:** Orchid Chetia Phukan, Girish, Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Swarup Ranjan Behera, Pailla Balakrishna Reddy, Arun Balaji Buduru, Rajesh Sharma

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02232

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we focus on Singing Voice Mean Opinion Score (SingMOS) prediction. Previous research have shown the performance benefit with the use of state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models (PTMs). However, they haven't explored speaker recognition speech PTMs (SPTMs) such as x-vector, ECAPA and we hypothesize that it will be the most effective for SingMOS prediction. We believe that due to their speaker recognition pre-training, it equips them to capture fine-grained vocal features (e.g., pitch, tone, intensity) from synthesized singing voices in a much more better way than other PTMs. Our experiments with SOTA PTMs including SPTMs and music PTMs validates the hypothesis. Additionally, we introduce a novel fusion framework, BATCH that uses Bhattacharya Distance for fusion of PTMs. Through BATCH with the fusion of speaker recognition SPTMs, we report the topmost performance comparison to all the individual PTMs and baseline fusion techniques as well as setting SOTA.
#### Are Mamba-based Audio Foundation Models the Best Fit for Non-Verbal Emotion Recognition?
 - **Authors:** Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Orchid Chetia Phukan, Girish, Swarup Ranjan Behera, Ananda Chandra Nayak, Sanjib Kumar Nayak, Arun Balaji Buduru, Rajesh Sharma

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02258

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we focus on non-verbal vocal sounds emotion recognition (NVER). We investigate mamba-based audio foundation models (MAFMs) for the first time for NVER and hypothesize that MAFMs will outperform attention-based audio foundation models (AAFMs) for NVER by leveraging its state-space modeling to capture intrinsic emotional structures more effectively. Unlike AAFMs, which may amplify irrelevant patterns due to their attention mechanisms, MAFMs will extract more stable and context-aware representations, enabling better differentiation of subtle non-verbal emotional cues. Our experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) AAFMs and MAFMs validates our hypothesis. Further, motivated from related research such as speech emotion recognition, synthetic speech detection, where fusion of foundation models (FMs) have showed improved performance, we also explore fusion of FMs for NVER. To this end, we propose, RENO, that uses renyi-divergence as a novel loss function for effective alignment of the FMs. It also makes use of self-attention for better intra-representation interaction of the FMs. With RENO, through the heterogeneous fusion of MAFMs and AAFMs, we show the topmost performance in comparison to individual FMs, its fusion and also setting SOTA in comparison to previous SOTA work.
#### Enhancing Lyrics Transcription on Music Mixtures with Consistency Loss
 - **Authors:** Jiawen Huang, Felipe Sousa, Emir Demirel, Emmanouil Benetos, Igor Gadelha
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02339

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02339

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic Lyrics Transcription (ALT) aims to recognize lyrics from singing voices, similar to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for spoken language, but faces added complexity due to domain-specific properties of the singing voice. While foundation ASR models show robustness in various speech tasks, their performance degrades on singing voice, especially in the presence of musical accompaniment. This work focuses on this performance gap and explores Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for ALT, investigating both single-domain and dual-domain fine-tuning strategies. We propose using a consistency loss to better align vocal and mixture encoder representations, improving transcription on mixture without relying on singing voice separation. Our results show that while naïve dual-domain fine-tuning underperforms, structured training with consistency loss yields modest but consistent gains, demonstrating the potential of adapting ASR foundation models for music.
#### Prompt-Unseen-Emotion: Zero-shot Expressive Speech Synthesis with Prompt-LLM Contextual Knowledge for Mixed Emotions

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02742

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02742

 - **Abstract**
 Existing expressive text-to-speech (TTS) systems primarily model a limited set of categorical emotions, whereas human conversations extend far beyond these predefined emotions, making it essential to explore more diverse emotional speech generation for more natural interactions. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel prompt-unseen-emotion (PUE) approach to generate unseen emotional speech via emotion-guided prompt learning. PUE is trained utilizing an LLM-TTS architecture to ensure emotional consistency between categorical emotion-relevant prompts and emotional speech, allowing the model to quantitatively capture different emotion weightings per utterance. During inference, mixed emotional speech can be generated by flexibly adjusting emotion proportions and leveraging LLM contextual knowledge, enabling the model to quantify different emotional styles. Our proposed PUE successfully facilitates expressive speech synthesis of unseen emotions in a zero-shot setting.
#### CapSpeech: Enabling Downstream Applications in Style-Captioned Text-to-Speech

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have significantly transformed the field of style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis (CapTTS). However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks, including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events (CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS (EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36 million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks. The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the challenges of developing CapTTS systems.
#### Diffusion Buffer: Online Diffusion-based Speech Enhancement with Sub-Second Latency

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02908

 - **Abstract**
 Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have been recently used for speech enhancement with remarkable success but are computationally expensive at inference time. Therefore, these models are impractical for processing streaming data in real-time. In this work, we adapt a sliding window diffusion framework to the speech enhancement task. Our approach progressively corrupts speech signals through time, assigning more noise to frames close to the present in a buffer. This approach outputs denoised frames with a delay proportional to the chosen buffer size, enabling a trade-off between performance and latency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms standard diffusion models and runs efficiently on a GPU, achieving an input-output latency in the order of 0.3 to 1 seconds. This marks the first practical diffusion-based solution for online speech enhancement.
#### PartialEdit: Identifying Partial Deepfakes in the Era of Neural Speech Editing
 - **Authors:** You Zhang, Baotong Tian, Lin Zhang, Zhiyao Duan

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02958

 - **Abstract**
 Neural speech editing enables seamless partial edits to speech utterances, allowing modifications to selected content while preserving the rest of the audio unchanged. This useful technique, however, also poses new risks of deepfakes. To encourage research on detecting such partially edited deepfake speech, we introduce PartialEdit, a deepfake speech dataset curated using advanced neural editing techniques. We explore both detection and localization tasks on PartialEdit. Our experiments reveal that models trained on the existing PartialSpoof dataset fail to detect partially edited speech generated by neural speech editing models. As recent speech editing models almost all involve neural audio codecs, we also provide insights into the artifacts the model learned on detecting these deepfakes. Further information about the PartialEdit dataset and audio samples can be found on the project page: this https URL.
#### DYNAC: Dynamic Vocabulary based Non-Autoregressive Contextualization for Speech Recognition

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00422

 - **Abstract**
 Contextual biasing (CB) improves automatic speech recognition for rare and unseen phrases. Recent studies have introduced dynamic vocabulary, which represents context phrases as expandable tokens in autoregressive (AR) models. This method improves CB accuracy but with slow inference speed. While dynamic vocabulary can be applied to non-autoregressive (NAR) models, such as connectionist temporal classification (CTC), the conditional independence assumption fails to capture dependencies between static and dynamic tokens. This paper proposes DYNAC (Dynamic Vocabulary-based NAR Contextualization), a self-conditioned CTC method that integrates dynamic vocabulary into intermediate layers. Conditioning the encoder on dynamic vocabulary, DYNAC effectively captures dependencies between static and dynamic tokens while reducing the real-time factor (RTF). Experimental results show that DYNAC reduces RTF by 81% with a 0.1-point degradation in word error rate on the LibriSpeech 960 test-clean set.

 - **Abstract**
 Conversational agents that mimic people have raised questions about the ethics of anthropomorphizing machines with human social identity cues. Critics have also questioned assumptions of identity neutrality in humanlike agents. Recent work has revealed that intersectional Japanese pronouns can elicit complex and sometimes evasive impressions of agent identity. Yet, the role of other "neutral" non-pronominal self-referents (NPSR) and voice as a socially expressive medium remains unexplored. In a crowdsourcing study, Japanese participants (N = 204) evaluated three ChatGPT voices (Juniper, Breeze, and Ember) using seven self-referents. We found strong evidence of voice gendering alongside the potential of intersectional self-referents to evade gendering, i.e., ambiguity through neutrality and elusiveness. Notably, perceptions of age and formality intersected with gendering as per sociolinguistic theories, especially boku and watakushi. This work provides a nuanced take on agent identity perceptions and champions intersectional and culturally-sensitive work on voice agents.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02010

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the second Chinese Continuous Visual Speech Recognition Challenge (CNVSRC 2024), which builds on CNVSRC 2023 to advance research in Chinese Large Vocabulary Continuous Visual Speech Recognition (LVC-VSR). The challenge evaluates two test scenarios: reading in recording studios and Internet speech. CNVSRC 2024 uses the same datasets as its predecessor CNVSRC 2023, which involves CN-CVS for training and CNVSRC-Single/Multi for development and evaluation. However, CNVSRC 2024 introduced two key improvements: (1) a stronger baseline system, and (2) an additional dataset, CN-CVS2-P1, for open tracks to improve data volume and diversity. The new challenge has demonstrated several important innovations in data preprocessing, feature extraction, model design, and training strategies, further pushing the state-of-the-art in Chinese LVC-VSR. More details and resources are available at the official website.
#### Leveraging Large Language Models in Visual Speech Recognition: Model Scaling, Context-Aware Decoding, and Iterative Polishing

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02012

 - **Abstract**
 Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) transcribes speech by analyzing lip movements. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into VSR systems, leading to notable performance improvements. However, the potential of LLMs has not been extensively studied, and how to effectively utilize LLMs in VSR tasks remains unexplored. This paper systematically explores how to better leverage LLMs for VSR tasks and provides three key contributions: (1) Scaling Test: We study how the LLM size affects VSR performance, confirming a scaling law in the VSR task. (2) Context-Aware Decoding: We add contextual text to guide the LLM decoding, improving recognition accuracy. (3) Iterative Polishing: We propose iteratively refining LLM outputs, progressively reducing recognition errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by these designs, the great potential of LLMs can be largely harnessed, leading to significant VSR performance improvement.
#### Unveiling Audio Deepfake Origins: A Deep Metric learning And Conformer Network Approach With Ensemble Fusion

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02085

 - **Abstract**
 Audio deepfakes are acquiring an unprecedented level of realism with advanced AI. While current research focuses on discerning real speech from spoofed speech, tracing the source system is equally crucial. This work proposes a novel audio source tracing system combining deep metric multi-class N-pair loss with Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion framework, a Conformer classification network, and ensemble score-embedding fusion. The N-pair loss improves discriminative ability, while Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion enhance robustness by focusing on differentiating real and fake speech patterns. The Conformer network captures both global and local dependencies in the audio signal, crucial for source tracing. The proposed ensemble score-embedding fusion shows an optimal trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain source tracing scenarios. We evaluate our method using Frechet Distance and standard metrics, demonstrating superior performance in source tracing over the baseline system.
#### HENT-SRT: Hierarchical Efficient Neural Transducer with Self-Distillation for Joint Speech Recognition and Translation
 - **Authors:** Amir Hussein, Cihan Xiao, Matthew Wiesner, Dan Povey, Leibny Paola Garcia, Sanjeev Khudanpur

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02157

 - **Abstract**
 Neural transducers (NT) provide an effective framework for speech streaming, demonstrating strong performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, the application of NT to speech translation (ST) remains challenging, as existing approaches struggle with word reordering and performance degradation when jointly modeling ASR and ST, resulting in a gap with attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models. Existing NT-based ST approaches also suffer from high computational training costs. To address these issues, we propose HENT-SRT (Hierarchical Efficient Neural Transducer for Speech Recognition and Translation), a novel framework that factorizes ASR and translation tasks to better handle reordering. To ensure robust ST while preserving ASR performance, we use self-distillation with CTC consistency regularization. Moreover, we improve computational efficiency by incorporating best practices from ASR transducers, including a down-sampled hierarchical encoder, a stateless predictor, and a pruned transducer loss to reduce training complexity. Finally, we introduce a blank penalty during decoding, reducing deletions and improving translation quality. Our approach is evaluated on three conversational datasets Arabic, Spanish, and Mandarin achieving new state-of-the-art performance among NT models and substantially narrowing the gap with AED-based systems.
#### Investigating the Impact of Word Informativeness on Speech Emotion Recognition

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02239

 - **Abstract**
 In emotion recognition from speech, a key challenge lies in identifying speech signal segments that carry the most relevant acoustic variations for discerning specific emotions. Traditional approaches compute functionals for features such as energy and F0 over entire sentences or longer speech portions, potentially missing essential fine-grained variation in the long-form statistics. This research investigates the use of word informativeness, derived from a pre-trained language model, to identify semantically important segments. Acoustic features are then computed exclusively for these identified segments, enhancing emotion recognition accuracy. The methodology utilizes standard acoustic prosodic features, their functionals, and self-supervised representations. Results indicate a notable improvement in recognition performance when features are computed on segments selected based on word informativeness, underscoring the effectiveness of this approach.
#### Sounding Like a Winner? Prosodic Differences in Post-Match Interviews

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the prosodic characteristics associated with winning and losing in post-match tennis interviews. Additionally, this research explores the potential to classify match outcomes solely based on post-match interview recordings using prosodic features and self-supervised learning (SSL) representations. By analyzing prosodic elements such as pitch and intensity, alongside SSL models like Wav2Vec 2.0 and HuBERT, the aim is to determine whether an athlete has won or lost their match. Traditional acoustic features and deep speech representations are extracted from the data, and machine learning classifiers are employed to distinguish between winning and losing players. Results indicate that SSL representations effectively differentiate between winning and losing outcomes, capturing subtle speech patterns linked to emotional states. At the same time, prosodic cues -- such as pitch variability -- remain strong indicators of victory.

 - **Abstract**
 With the continuous development of deep learning-based speech conversion and speech synthesis technologies, the cybersecurity problem posed by fake audio has become increasingly serious. Previously proposed models for defending against fake audio have attained remarkable performance. However, they all fall short in modeling the trustworthiness of the decisions made by the models themselves. Based on this, we put forward a plausible fake audio detection approach based on the Dirichlet distribution with the aim of enhancing the reliability of fake audio detection. Specifically, we first generate evidence through a neural network. Uncertainty is then modeled using the Dirichlet distribution. By modeling the belief distribution with the parameters of the Dirichlet distribution, an estimate of uncertainty can be obtained for each decision. Finally, the predicted probabilities and corresponding uncertainty estimates are combined to form the final opinion. On the ASVspoof series dataset (i.e., ASVspoof 2019 LA, ASVspoof 2021 LA, and DF), we conduct a number of comparison experiments to verify the excellent performance of the proposed model in terms of accuracy, robustness, and trustworthiness.
#### StarVC: A Unified Auto-Regressive Framework for Joint Text and Speech Generation in Voice Conversion

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02414

 - **Abstract**
 Voice Conversion (VC) modifies speech to match a target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Traditional methods usually extract speaker information directly from speech while neglecting the explicit utilization of linguistic content. Since VC fundamentally involves disentangling speaker identity from linguistic content, leveraging structured semantic features could enhance conversion performance. However, previous attempts to incorporate semantic features into VC have shown limited effectiveness, motivating the integration of explicit text modeling. We propose StarVC, a unified autoregressive VC framework that first predicts text tokens before synthesizing acoustic features. The experiments demonstrate that StarVC outperforms conventional VC methods in preserving both linguistic content (i.e., WER and CER) and speaker characteristics (i.e., SECS and MOS).

 - **Abstract**
 While global linguistic diversity spans more than 7164 recognized languages, the current dominant architecture of machine intelligence remains fundamentally biased toward written text. This bias excludes over 700 million people particularly in rural and remote regions who are audio-literate. In this work, we introduce a fully textless, audio-to-audio machine intelligence framework designed to serve this underserved population, and all the people who prefer audio-efficiency. Our contributions include novel Audio-to-Audio translation architectures that bypass text entirely, including spectrogram-, scalogram-, wavelet-, and unit-based models. Central to our approach is the Multiscale Audio-Semantic Transform (MAST), a representation that encodes tonal, prosodic, speaker, and expressive features. We further integrate MAST into a fractional diffusion of mean-field-type framework powered by fractional Brownian motion. It enables the generation of high-fidelity, semantically consistent speech without reliance on textual supervision. The result is a robust and scalable system capable of learning directly from raw audio, even in languages that are unwritten or rarely digitized. This work represents a fundamental shift toward audio-native machine intelligence systems, expanding access to language technologies for communities historically left out of the current machine intelligence ecosystem.

 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to the steady progress of large language models (LLMs), speech encoding algorithms and vocoder structure, recent advancements have enabled generating speech response directly from a user instruction. However, benchmarking the generated speech quality has been a neglected but critical issue, considering the shift from the pursuit of semantic accuracy to vivid and spontaneous speech flow. Previous evaluation focused on the speech-understanding ability, lacking a quantification of acoustic quality. In this paper, we propose Speech cOnversational Voice Assistant Benchmark (SOVA-Bench), providing a comprehension comparison of the general knowledge, speech recognition and understanding, along with both semantic and acoustic generative ability between available speech LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, SOVA-Bench is one of the most systematic evaluation frameworks for speech LLMs, inspiring the direction of voice interaction systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new dataset for cinematic audio source separation (CASS) that handles non-verbal sounds. Existing CASS datasets only contain reading-style sounds as a speech stem. These datasets differ from actual movie audio, which is more likely to include acted-out voices. Consequently, models trained on conventional datasets tend to have issues where emotionally heightened voices, such as laughter and screams, are more easily separated as an effect, not speech. To address this problem, we build a new dataset, DnR-nonverbal. The proposed dataset includes non-verbal sounds like laughter and screams in the speech stem. From the experiments, we reveal the issue of non-verbal sound extraction by the current CASS model and show that our dataset can effectively address the issue in the synthetic and actual movie audio.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, there has been a growing focus on fairness and inclusivity within speech technology, particularly in areas such as automatic speech recognition and speech sentiment analysis. When audio is transcoded prior to processing, as is the case in streaming or real-time applications, any inherent bias in the coding mechanism may result in disparities. This not only affects user experience but can also have broader societal implications by perpetuating stereotypes and exclusion. Thus, it is important that audio coding mechanisms are unbiased. In this work, we contribute towards the scarce research with respect to language and gender biases of audio codecs. By analyzing the speech quality of over 2 million multilingual audio files after transcoding through a representative subset of codecs (PSTN, VoIP and neural), our results indicate that PSTN codecs are strongly biased in terms of gender and that neural codecs introduce language biases.
#### Prosodic Structure Beyond Lexical Content: A Study of Self-Supervised Learning

 - **Abstract**
 People exploit the predictability of lexical structures during text comprehension. Though predictable structure is also present in speech, the degree to which prosody, e.g. intonation, tempo, and loudness, contributes to such structure independently of the lexical content is unclear. This study leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to examine the temporal granularity of structures in the acoustic correlates of prosody. Representations from our proposed Masked Prosody Model can predict perceptual labels dependent on local information, such as word boundaries, but provide the most value for labels involving longer-term structures, like emotion recognition. Probing experiments across various perceptual labels show strong relative gains over untransformed pitch, energy, and voice activity features. Our results reveal the importance of SSL training objective timescale and highlight the value of complex SSL-encoded structures compared to more constrained classical structures.
#### Speaker Diarization with Overlapping Community Detection Using Graph Attention Networks and Label Propagation Algorithm

 - **Abstract**
 In speaker diarization, traditional clustering-based methods remain widely used in real-world applications. However, these methods struggle with the complex distribution of speaker embeddings and overlapping speech segments. To address these limitations, we propose an Overlapping Community Detection method based on Graph Attention networks and the Label Propagation Algorithm (OCDGALP). The proposed framework comprises two key components: (1) a graph attention network that refines speaker embeddings and node connections by aggregating information from neighboring nodes, and (2) a label propagation algorithm that assigns multiple community labels to each node, enabling simultaneous clustering and overlapping community detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the Diarization Error Rate (DER), achieving a state-of-the-art 15.94% DER on the DIHARD-III dataset without oracle Voice Activity Detection (VAD), and an impressive 11.07% with oracle VAD.
#### Overcoming Data Scarcity in Multi-Dialectal Arabic ASR via Whisper Fine-Tuning

 - **Abstract**
 Although commercial Arabic automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems support Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), they struggle with dialectal speech. We investigate the effect of fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper on five major Arabic dialects (Gulf, Levantine, Iraqi, Egyptian, Maghrebi) using Mozilla Common Voice for MSA and the MASC dataset for dialectal speech. We evaluate MSA training size effects, benefits of pre-training on MSA data, and dialect-specific versus dialect-pooled models. We find that small amounts of MSA fine-tuning data yield substantial improvements for smaller models, matching larger non-fine-tuned models. While MSA pre-training shows minimal benefit, suggesting limited shared features between MSA and dialects, our dialect-pooled models perform comparably to dialect-specific ones. This indicates that pooling dialectal data, when properly balanced, can help address data scarcity in low-resource ASR without significant performance loss.
#### A Multi-Dialectal Dataset for German Dialect ASR and Dialect-to-Standard Speech Translation

 - **Abstract**
 Although Germany has a diverse landscape of dialects, they are underrepresented in current automatic speech recognition (ASR) research. To enable studies of how robust models are towards dialectal variation, we present Betthupferl, an evaluation dataset containing four hours of read speech in three dialect groups spoken in Southeast Germany (Franconian, Bavarian, Alemannic), and half an hour of Standard German speech. We provide both dialectal and Standard German transcriptions, and analyze the linguistic differences between them. We benchmark several multilingual state-of-the-art ASR models on speech translation into Standard German, and find differences between how much the output resembles the dialectal vs. standardized transcriptions. Qualitative error analyses of the best ASR model reveal that it sometimes normalizes grammatical differences, but often stays closer to the dialectal constructions.

 - **Abstract**
 Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems, which can model simultaneous bidirectional features of human conversations such as speech overlaps and backchannels, have attracted significant attention recently. However, the study of full-duplex spoken dialogue systems for the Japanese language has been limited, and the research on their development in Japanese remains scarce. In this paper, we present the first publicly available full-duplex spoken dialogue model in Japanese, which is built upon Moshi, a full-duplex dialogue model in English. Our model is trained through a two-stage process: pre-training on a large-scale spoken dialogue data in Japanese, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality stereo spoken dialogue data. We further enhance the model's performance by incorporating synthetic dialogue data generated by a multi-stream text-to-speech system. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the trained model outperforms Japanese baseline models in both naturalness and meaningfulness.
