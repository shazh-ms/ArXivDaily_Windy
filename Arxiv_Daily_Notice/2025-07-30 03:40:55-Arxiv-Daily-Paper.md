#### Real-Time Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Using Pre-trained Visual Representations

 - **Abstract**
 Speech enhancement in audio-only settings remains challenging, particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. This paper presents a simple yet effective real-time audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system, RAVEN, which isolates and enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing interfering speakers and background noise. We investigate how visual embeddings learned from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker detection (ASD) contribute to AVSE across different SNR conditions and numbers of interfering speakers. Our results show concatenating embeddings from AVSR and ASD models provides the greatest improvement in low-SNR, multi-speaker environments, while AVSR embeddings alone perform best in noise-only scenarios. In addition, we develop a real-time streaming system that operates on a computer CPU and we provide a video demonstration and code repository. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE system.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source our training and modeling code under an MIT license.
#### A Deep Learning Automatic Speech Recognition Model for Shona Language
 - **Authors:** Leslie Wellington Sirora, Mainford Mutandavari
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21331

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21331

 - **Abstract**
 This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers worldwide.
#### Relationship between objective and subjective perceptual measures of speech in individuals with head and neck cancer
 - **Authors:** Bence Mark Halpern, Thomas Tienkamp, Teja Rebernik, Rob J.J.H. van Son, Martijn Wieling, Defne Abur, Tomoki Toda
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21426

 - **Abstract**
 Meaningful speech assessment is vital in clinical phonetics and therapy monitoring. This study examined the link between perceptual speech assessments and objective acoustic measures in a large head and neck cancer (HNC) dataset. Trained listeners provided ratings of intelligibility, articulation, voice quality, phonation, speech rate, nasality, and background noise on speech. Strong correlations were found between subjective intelligibility, articulation, and voice quality, likely due to a shared underlying cause of speech symptoms in our speaker population. Objective measures of intelligibility and speech rate aligned with their subjective counterpart. Our results suggest that a single intelligibility measure may be sufficient for the clinical monitoring of speakers treated for HNC using concomitant chemoradiation.
#### Sound Source Localization for Human-Robot Interaction in Outdoor Environments
 - **Authors:** Victor Liu, Timothy Du, Jordy Sehn, Jack Collier, FranÃ§ois Grondin
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Robotics (cs.RO); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21431

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21431

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a sound source localization strategy that relies on a microphone array embedded in an unmanned ground vehicle and an asynchronous close-talking microphone near the operator. A signal coarse alignment strategy is combined with a time-domain acoustic echo cancellation algorithm to estimate a time-frequency ideal ratio mask to isolate the target speech from interferences and environmental noise. This allows selective sound source localization, and provides the robot with the direction of arrival of sound from the active operator, which enables rich interaction in noisy scenarios. Results demonstrate an average angle error of 4 degrees and an accuracy within 5 degrees of 95\% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 1dB, which is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art localization methods.

 - **Abstract**
 As speech generation technology advances, the risk of misuse through deepfake audio has become a pressing concern, which underscores the critical need for robust detection systems. However, many existing speech deepfake datasets are limited in scale and diversity, making it challenging to train models that can generalize well to unseen deepfakes. To address these gaps, we introduce SpeechFake, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for speech deepfake detection. SpeechFake includes over 3 million deepfake samples, totaling more than 3,000 hours of audio, generated using 40 different speech synthesis tools. The dataset encompasses a wide range of generation techniques, including text-to-speech, voice conversion, and neural vocoder, incorporating the latest cutting-edge methods. It also provides multilingual support, spanning 46 languages. In this paper, we offer a detailed overview of the dataset's creation, composition, and statistics. We also present baseline results by training detection models on SpeechFake, demonstrating strong performance on both its own test sets and various unseen test sets. Additionally, we conduct experiments to rigorously explore how generation methods, language diversity, and speaker variation affect detection performance. We believe SpeechFake will be a valuable resource for advancing speech deepfake detection and developing more robust models for evolving generation techniques.
