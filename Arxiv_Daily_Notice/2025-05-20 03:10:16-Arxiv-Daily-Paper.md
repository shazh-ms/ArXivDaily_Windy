 - **Abstract**
 Keyword spotting (KWS) offers a vital mechanism to identify spoken commands in voice-enabled systems, where user demands often shift, requiring models to learn new keywords continually over time. However, a major problem is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their ability to recognize earlier keywords. Although several continual learning methods have proven their usefulness for reducing forgetting, most existing approaches depend on storing and revisiting old data to combat catastrophic forgetting. Though effective, these methods face two practical challenges: 1) privacy risks from keeping user data and 2) large memory and time consumption that limit deployment on small devices. To address these issues, we propose an exemplar-free Analytic Continual Learning (AnalyticKWS) method that updates model parameters without revisiting earlier data. Inspired by efficient learning principles, AnalyticKWS computes a closed-form analytical solution for model updates and requires only a single epoch of adaptation for incoming keywords. AnalyticKWS demands fewer computational resources by avoiding gradient-based updates and does not store old data. By eliminating the need for back-propagation during incremental learning, the model remains lightweight and efficient. As a result, AnalyticKWS meets the challenges mentioned earlier and suits resource-limited settings well. Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings show that AnalyticKWS consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods.
#### Shallow Flow Matching for Coarse-to-Fine Text-to-Speech Synthesis

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a shallow flow matching (SFM) mechanism to enhance flow matching (FM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models within a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths using coarse output representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow. The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise and focuses computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments show that SFM consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech in both objective and subjective evaluations, while significantly reducing inference when using adaptive-step ODE solvers.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12288

 - **Abstract**
 Conventional speech enhancement (SE) aims to improve speech perception and intelligibility by suppressing noise without requiring enrollment speech as reference, whereas personalized SE (PSE) addresses the cocktail party problem by extracting a target speaker's speech using enrollment speech. While these two tasks tackle different yet complementary challenges in speech signal processing, they often share similar model architectures, with PSE incorporating an additional branch to process enrollment speech. This suggests developing a unified model capable of efficiently handling both SE and PSE tasks, thereby simplifying deployment while maintaining high performance. However, PSE performance is sensitive to variations in enrollment speech, like emotional tone, which limits robustness in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose two novel models, USEF-PNet and DSEF-PNet, both extending our previous SEF-PNet framework. USEF-PNet introduces a unified architecture for processing enrollment speech, integrating SE and PSE into a single framework to enhance performance and streamline deployment. Meanwhile, DSEF-PNet incorporates an unsupervised speech disentanglement approach by pairing a mixture speech with two different enrollment utterances and enforcing consistency in the extracted target speech. This strategy effectively isolates high-quality speaker identity information from enrollment speech, reducing interference from factors such as emotion and content, thereby improving PSE robustness. Additionally, we explore a long-short enrollment pairing (LSEP) strategy to examine the impact of enrollment speech duration during both training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on the Libri2Mix and VoiceBank DEMAND demonstrate that our proposed USEF-PNet, DSEF-PNet all achieve substantial performance improvements, with random enrollment duration performing slightly better.
#### MDDM: A Multi-view Discriminative Enhanced Diffusion-based Model for Speech Enhancement
 - **Authors:** Nan Xu, Zhaolong Huang, Xiaonan Zhi

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13029

 - **Abstract**
 With the development of deep learning, speech enhancement has been greatly optimized in terms of speech quality. Previous methods typically focus on the discriminative supervised learning or generative modeling, which tends to introduce speech distortions or high computational cost. In this paper, we propose MDDM, a Multi-view Discriminative enhanced Diffusion-based Model. Specifically, we take the features of three domains (time, frequency and noise) as inputs of a discriminative prediction network, generating the preliminary spectrogram. Then, the discriminative output can be converted to clean speech by several inference sampling steps. Due to the intersection of the distributions between discriminative output and clean target, the smaller sampling steps can achieve the competitive performance compared to other diffusion-based methods. Experiments conducted on a public dataset and a realworld dataset validate the effectiveness of MDDM, either on subjective or objective metric.
#### Cross-modal Knowledge Transfer Learning as Graph Matching Based on Optimal Transport for ASR

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13079

 - **Abstract**
 Transferring linguistic knowledge from a pretrained language model (PLM) to acoustic feature learning has proven effective in enhancing end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR). However, aligning representations between linguistic and acoustic modalities remains a challenge due to inherent modality gaps. Optimal transport (OT) has shown promise in mitigating these gaps by minimizing the Wasserstein distance (WD) between linguistic and acoustic feature distributions. However, previous OT-based methods overlook structural relationships, treating feature vectors as unordered sets. To address this, we propose Graph Matching Optimal Transport (GM-OT), which models linguistic and acoustic sequences as structured graphs. Nodes represent feature embeddings, while edges capture temporal and sequential relationships. GM-OT minimizes both WD (between nodes) and Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD) (between edges), leading to a fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance (FGWD) formulation. This enables structured alignment and more efficient knowledge transfer compared to existing OT-based approaches. Theoretical analysis further shows that prior OT-based methods in linguistic knowledge transfer can be viewed as a special case within our GM-OT framework. We evaluate GM-OT on Mandarin ASR using a CTC-based E2E-ASR system with a PLM for knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art models, validating the effectiveness of our approach.
#### Universal Semantic Disentangled Privacy-preserving Speech Representation Learning

 - **Abstract**
 The use of audio recordings of human speech to train LLMs poses privacy concerns due to these models' potential to generate outputs that closely resemble artifacts in the training data. In this study, we propose a speaker privacy-preserving representation learning method through the Universal Speech Codec (USC), a computationally efficient encoder-decoder model that disentangles speech into: $\textit{(i)}$ privacy-preserving semantically rich representations, capturing content and speech paralinguistics, and $\textit{(ii)}$ residual acoustic and speaker representations that enables high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive evaluations presented show that USC's semantic representation preserves content, prosody, and sentiment, while removing potentially identifiable speaker attributes. Combining both representations, USC achieves state-of-the-art speech reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation methodology for measuring privacy-preserving properties, aligning with perceptual tests. We compare USC against other codecs in the literature and demonstrate its effectiveness on privacy-preserving representation learning, illustrating the trade-offs of speaker anonymization, paralinguistics retention and content preservation in the learned semantic representations.

#### SAKURA: On the Multi-hop Reasoning of Large Audio-Language Models Based on Speech and Audio Information

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13237

 - **Abstract**
 Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation. Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks, conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11572

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become ubiquitous in everyday applications, yet significant disparities in performance across diverse demographic groups persist. In this work, we introduce the ASR-FAIRBENCH leaderboard which is designed to assess both the accuracy and equity of ASR models in real-time. Leveraging the Meta's Fair-Speech dataset, which captures diverse demographic characteristics, we employ a mixed-effects Poisson regression model to derive an overall fairness score. This score is integrated with traditional metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) to compute the Fairness Adjusted ASR Score (FAAS), providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Our approach reveals significant performance disparities in SOTA ASR models across demographic groups and offers a benchmark to drive the development of more inclusive ASR technologies.

 - **Abstract**
 Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have transformed human-computer interaction; however, low-resource languages in Africa remain significantly underrepresented in both research and practical applications. This study investigates the major challenges hindering the development of ASR systems for these languages, which include data scarcity, linguistic complexity, limited computational resources, acoustic variability, and ethical concerns surrounding bias and privacy. The primary goal is to critically analyze these barriers and identify practical, inclusive strategies to advance ASR technologies within the African context. Recent advances and case studies emphasize promising strategies such as community-driven data collection, self-supervised and multilingual learning, lightweight model architectures, and techniques that prioritize privacy. Evidence from pilot projects involving various African languages showcases the feasibility and impact of customized solutions, which encompass morpheme-based modeling and domain-specific ASR applications in sectors like healthcare and education. The findings highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to tackle the distinct linguistic and infrastructural challenges faced by the continent. This study offers a progressive roadmap for creating ethical, efficient, and inclusive ASR systems that not only safeguard linguistic diversity but also improve digital accessibility and promote socioeconomic participation for speakers of African languages.
#### SepPrune: Structured Pruning for Efficient Deep Speech Separation

 - **Abstract**
 Although deep learning has substantially advanced speech separation in recent years, most existing studies continue to prioritize separation quality while overlooking computational efficiency, an essential factor for low-latency speech processing in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose SepPrune, the first structured pruning framework specifically designed to compress deep speech separation models and reduce their computational cost. SepPrune begins by analyzing the computational structure of a given model to identify layers with the highest computational burden. It then introduces a differentiable masking strategy to enable gradient-driven channel selection. Based on the learned masks, SepPrune prunes redundant channels and fine-tunes the remaining parameters to recover performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this learnable pruning paradigm yields substantial advantages for channel pruning in speech separation models, outperforming existing methods. Notably, a model pruned with SepPrune can recover 85% of the performance of a pre-trained model (trained over hundreds of epochs) with only one epoch of fine-tuning, and achieves convergence 36$\times$ faster than training from scratch.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12192

 - **Abstract**
 Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a growing global health challenge, with Bangladesh experiencing a notable rise in PD-related mortality. Early detection of PD remains particularly challenging in resource-constrained settings, where voice-based analysis has emerged as a promising non-invasive and cost-effective alternative. However, existing studies predominantly focus on English or other major languages; notably, no voice dataset for PD exists for Bengali - posing a significant barrier to culturally inclusive and accessible healthcare solutions. Moreover, most prior studies employed only a narrow set of acoustic features, with limited or no hyperparameter tuning and feature selection strategies, and little attention to model explainability. This restricts the development of a robust and generalizable machine learning model. To address this gap, we present BenSparX, the first Bengali conversational speech dataset for PD detection, along with a robust and explainable machine learning framework tailored for early diagnosis. The proposed framework incorporates diverse acoustic feature categories, systematic feature selection methods, and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with extensive hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, to enhance interpretability and trust in model predictions, the framework incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to quantify the contribution of individual acoustic features toward PD detection. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding an accuracy of 95.77%, F1 score of 95.57%, and AUC-ROC of 0.982. We further externally validated our approach by applying the framework to existing PD datasets in other languages, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, the dataset has been made publicly available at this https URL.
#### VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12332

 - **Abstract**
 Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at this https URL.
#### Chain-Talker: Chain Understanding and Rendering for Empathetic Conversational Speech Synthesis

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12597

 - **Abstract**
 Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to align synthesized speech with the emotional and stylistic context of user-agent interactions to achieve empathy. Current generative CSS models face interpretability limitations due to insufficient emotional perception and redundant discrete speech coding. To address the above issues, we present Chain-Talker, a three-stage framework mimicking human cognition: Emotion Understanding derives context-aware emotion descriptors from dialogue history; Semantic Understanding generates compact semantic codes via serialized prediction; and Empathetic Rendering synthesizes expressive speech by integrating both components. To support emotion modeling, we develop CSS-EmCap, an LLM-driven automated pipeline for generating precise conversational speech emotion captions. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Chain-Talker produces more expressive and empathetic speech than existing methods, with CSS-EmCap contributing to reliable emotion modeling. The code and demos are available at: this https URL.
#### RoVo: Robust Voice Protection Against Unauthorized Speech Synthesis with Embedding-Level Perturbations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12686

 - **Abstract**
 With the advancement of AI-based speech synthesis technologies such as Deep Voice, there is an increasing risk of voice spoofing attacks, including voice phishing and fake news, through unauthorized use of others' voices. Existing defenses that inject adversarial perturbations directly into audio signals have limited effectiveness, as these perturbations can easily be neutralized by speech enhancement methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoVo (Robust Voice), a novel proactive defense technique that injects adversarial perturbations into high-dimensional embedding vectors of audio signals, reconstructing them into protected speech. This approach effectively defends against speech synthesis attacks and also provides strong resistance to speech enhancement models, which represent a secondary attack threat. In extensive experiments, RoVo increased the Defense Success Rate (DSR) by over 70% compared to unprotected speech, across four state-of-the-art speech synthesis models. Specifically, RoVo achieved a DSR of 99.5% on a commercial speaker-verification API, effectively neutralizing speech synthesis attack. Moreover, RoVo's perturbations remained robust even under strong speech enhancement conditions, outperforming traditional methods. A user study confirmed that RoVo preserves both naturalness and usability of protected speech, highlighting its effectiveness in complex and evolving threat scenarios.
#### OZSpeech: One-step Zero-shot Speech Synthesis with Learned-Prior-Conditioned Flow Matching
 - **Authors:** Hieu-Nghia Huynh-Nguyen, Ngoc Son Nguyen, Huynh Nguyen Dang, Thieu Vo, Truong-Son Hy, Van Nguyen

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12800

 - **Abstract**
 Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have seen significant advancements in recent years, driven by improvements in deep learning and neural network architectures. Viewing the output speech as a data distribution, previous approaches often employ traditional speech representations, such as waveforms or spectrograms, within the Flow Matching framework. However, these methods have limitations, including overlooking various speech attributes and incurring high computational costs due to additional constraints introduced during training. To address these challenges, we introduce OZSpeech, the first TTS method to explore optimal transport conditional flow matching with one-step sampling and a learned prior as the condition, effectively disregarding preceding states and reducing the number of sampling steps. Our approach operates on disentangled, factorized components of speech in token format, enabling accurate modeling of each speech attribute, which enhances the TTS system's ability to precisely clone the prompt speech. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance over existing methods in content accuracy, naturalness, prosody generation, and speaker style preservation.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12991

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12991

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present our submission to the Speech Accessibility Project challenge for dysarthric speech recognition. We integrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning with latent audio representations to improve an encoder-decoder ASR system. Synthetic training data is generated by fine-tuning Parler-TTS to mimic dysarthric speech, using LLM-generated prompts for corpus-consistent target transcripts. Personalization with x-vectors consistently reduces word error rates (WERs) over non-personalized fine-tuning. AdaLoRA adapters outperform full fine-tuning and standard low-rank adaptation, achieving relative WER reductions of ~23% and ~22%, respectively. Further improvements (~5% WER reduction) come from incorporating wav2vec 2.0-based audio representations. Training with synthetic dysarthric speech yields up to ~7% relative WER improvement over personalized fine-tuning alone.
#### Codec-Based Deepfake Source Tracing via Neural Audio Codec Taxonomy

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12994

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG) models have produced remarkably realistic audio deepfakes. We refer to deepfake speech generated by CoSG systems as codec-based deepfake, or CodecFake. Although existing anti-spoofing research on CodecFake predominantly focuses on verifying the authenticity of audio samples, almost no attention was given to tracing the CoSG used in generating these deepfakes. In CodecFake generation, processes such as speech-to-unit encoding, discrete unit modeling, and unit-to-speech decoding are fundamentally based on neural audio codecs. Motivated by this, we introduce source tracing for CodecFake via neural audio codec taxonomy, which dissects neural audio codecs to trace CoSG. Our experimental results on the CodecFake+ dataset provide promising initial evidence for the feasibility of CodecFake source tracing while also highlighting several challenges that warrant further investigation.
#### DualCodec: A Low-Frame-Rate, Semantically-Enhanced Neural Audio Codec for Speech Generation

 - **Abstract**
 Neural audio codecs form the foundational building blocks for language model (LM)-based speech generation. Typically, there is a trade-off between frame rate and audio quality. This study introduces a low-frame-rate, semantically enhanced codec model. Existing approaches distill semantically rich self-supervised (SSL) representations into the first-layer codec tokens. This work proposes DualCodec, a dual-stream encoding approach that integrates SSL and waveform representations within an end-to-end codec framework. In this setting, DualCodec enhances the semantic information in the first-layer codec and enables the codec system to maintain high audio quality while operating at a low frame rate. Note that a low-frame-rate codec improves the efficiency of speech generation. Experimental results on audio codec and speech generation tasks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed DualCodec compared to state-of-the-art codec systems, such as Mimi Codec, SpeechTokenizer, DAC, and Encodec.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13032

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce MMAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the deep reasoning capabilities of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) across massive multi-disciplinary tasks. MMAR comprises 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets, collected from real-world internet videos and refined through iterative error corrections and quality checks to ensure high quality. Unlike existing benchmarks that are limited to specific domains of sound, music, or speech, MMAR extends them to a broad spectrum of real-world audio scenarios, including mixed-modality combinations of sound, music, and speech. Each question in MMAR is hierarchically categorized across four reasoning layers: Signal, Perception, Semantic, and Cultural, with additional sub-categories within each layer to reflect task diversity and complexity. To further foster research in this area, we annotate every question with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationale to promote future advancements in audio reasoning. Each item in the benchmark demands multi-step deep reasoning beyond surface-level understanding. Moreover, a part of the questions requires graduate-level perceptual and domain-specific knowledge, elevating the benchmark's difficulty and depth. We evaluate MMAR using a broad set of models, including Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), Large Audio Reasoning Models (LARMs), Omni Language Models (OLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with audio caption inputs. The performance of these models on MMAR highlights the benchmark's challenging nature, and our analysis further reveals critical limitations of understanding and reasoning capabilities among current models. We hope MMAR will serve as a catalyst for future advances in this important but little-explored area.

 - **Abstract**
 The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge conveys the need for speech-based suicide risk assessment in adolescents. This study investigates a multimodal approach for this challenge, integrating automatic transcription with WhisperX, linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa, and audio embeddings from WavLM. Additionally, handcrafted acoustic features -- including MFCCs, spectral contrast, and pitch-related statistics -- were incorporated. We explored three fusion strategies: early concatenation, modality-specific processing, and weighted attention with mixup regularization. Results show that weighted attention provided the best generalization, achieving 69% accuracy on the development set, though a performance gap between development and test sets highlights generalization challenges. Our findings, strictly tied to the MINI-KID framework, emphasize the importance of refining embedding representations and fusion mechanisms to enhance classification reliability.
#### MultiActor-Audiobook: Zero-Shot Audiobook Generation with Faces and Voices of Multiple Speakers

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13082

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce MultiActor-Audiobook, a zero-shot approach for generating audiobooks that automatically produces consistent, expressive, and speaker-appropriate prosody, including intonation and emotion. Previous audiobook systems have several limitations: they require users to manually configure the speaker's prosody, read each sentence with a monotonic tone compared to voice actors, or rely on costly training. However, our MultiActor-Audiobook addresses these issues by introducing two novel processes: (1) MSP (**Multimodal Speaker Persona Generation**) and (2) LSI (**LLM-based Script Instruction Generation**). With these two processes, MultiActor-Audiobook can generate more emotionally expressive audiobooks with a consistent speaker prosody without additional training. We compare our system with commercial products, through human and MLLM evaluations, achieving competitive results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MSP and LSI through ablation studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Existing causal speech separation models often underperform compared to non-causal models due to difficulties in retaining historical information. To address this, we propose the Time-Frequency Attention Cache Memory (TFACM) model, which effectively captures spatio-temporal relationships through an attention mechanism and cache memory (CM) for historical information storage. In TFACM, an LSTM layer captures frequency-relative positions, while causal modeling is applied to the time dimension using local and global representations. The CM module stores past information, and the causal attention refinement (CAR) module further enhances time-based feature representations for finer granularity. Experimental results showed that TFACM achieveed comparable performance to the SOTA TF-GridNet-Causal model, with significantly lower complexity and fewer trainable parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the progress in self-supervised learning (SSL) for speech and music, existing models treat these domains separately, limiting their capacity for unified audio understanding. A unified model is desirable for applications that require general representations, e.g. audio large language models. Nonetheless, directly training a general model for speech and music is computationally expensive. Knowledge Distillation of teacher ensembles may be a natural solution, but we posit that decoupling the distillation of the speech and music SSL models allows for more flexibility. Thus, we propose to learn distilled task vectors and then linearly interpolate them to form a unified speech+music model. This strategy enables flexible domain emphasis through adjustable weights and is also simpler to train. Experiments on speech and music benchmarks demonstrate that our method yields superior overall performance compared to ensemble distillation.
#### Contextual Paralinguistic Data Creation for Multi-Modal Speech-LLM: Data Condensation and Spoken QA Generation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13338

 - **Abstract**
 Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset. The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-task and multilingual approaches benefit large models, yet speech processing for low-resource languages remains underexplored due to data scarcity. To address this, we present Granary, a large-scale collection of speech datasets for recognition and translation across 25 European languages. This is the first open-source effort at this scale for both transcription and translation. We enhance data quality using a pseudo-labeling pipeline with segmentation, two-pass inference, hallucination filtering, and punctuation restoration. We further generate translation pairs from pseudo-labeled transcriptions using EuroLLM, followed by a data filtration pipeline. Designed for efficiency, our pipeline processes vast amount of data within hours. We assess models trained on processed data by comparing their performance on previously curated datasets for both high- and low-resource languages. Our findings show that these models achieve similar performance using approx. 50% less data. Dataset will be made available at this https URL
