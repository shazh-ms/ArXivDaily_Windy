 - **Abstract**
 Large language model (LLM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet contextual biasing for named entities and hotwords under large vocabularies remains challenging. In this work, we propose a scalable two-stage framework that integrates hotword retrieval with LLM-ASR adaptation. First, we extend the Global-Local Contrastive Language-Audio pre-trained model (GLCLAP) to retrieve a compact top-k set of hotword candidates from a large vocabulary via robustness-aware data augmentation and fuzzy matching. Second, we inject the retrieved candidates as textual prompts into an LLM-ASR model and fine-tune it with Generative Rejection-Based Policy Optimization (GRPO), using a task-driven reward that jointly optimizes hotword recognition and overall transcription accuracy. Experiments on hotword-focused test sets show substantial keyword error rate (KER) reductions while maintaining sentence accuracy on general ASR benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework for large-vocabulary contextual biasing.
#### Rare Word Recognition and Translation Without Fine-Tuning via Task Vector in Speech Models

 - **Abstract**
 Rare words remain a critical bottleneck for speech-to-text systems. While direct fine-tuning improves recognition of target words, it often incurs high cost, catastrophic forgetting, and limited scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free paradigm based on task vectors for rare word recognition and translation. By defining task vectors as parameter differences and introducing word-level task vector arithmetic, our approach enables flexible composition of rare-word capabilities, greatly enhancing scalability and reusability. Extensive experiments across multiple domains show that the proposed method matches or surpasses fine-tuned models on target words, improves general performance by about 5 BLEU, and mitigates catastrophic forgetting.
